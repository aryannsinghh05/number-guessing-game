# number-guessing-game
In this project, I developed a number guessing game using the C programming language. The program randomly generates a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the number. After each guess, the program provides feedback, indicating whether the guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number. The program uses the rand() function for random number generation, seeded with the current time to ensure the number changes every time the game is run. Additional features include tracking the number of attempts and offering the option to play again.
